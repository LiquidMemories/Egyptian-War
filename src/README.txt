This game is card game where two players battle with cards until all have been collected by one player. Only face cards will be able to win a player cards. When a player turns over a face card, depending on the face value, the opposite player will receive the following chances to play another face card. Jack= 1chance, Queen= 2chances, King= 3chances, Ace=4chances. 

I created the classes Player, EgyptianWar, and EgyptianWarTester. I choose to create these classes because the Player class handles the methods that a player can carry out, the EgyptianWar class handles the methods that the game controls, and the Tester class runs the actual program.

Some of the more useful methods I created are the loopChances method and the takePile method in the Player class and the checkWin method in the EgyptianWar class. The loopChances method takes the current number of chances the current player has and loops through each chance until the player turns over a face card. Once the face card has been played the chances of the new face card is returned to the opposite player. If no face card is turned over, the chances decrease until zero add the value of zero is returned. The takePile method empties out the ArrayList<String> pile and adds each of those values to the specific players hand. And the checkWin method checks after each turn to see if one of the player's ArrayList is empty, and if it is empty, the game ends.

The game prompts the user for the first player to enter a value of 1. Once that value has been entered the card is printed to the screen. If it is a face card the turn switches to the next player and prompts them for input until their chances have either run out or they turn over a face card switching it to the net player. 

The most challenging thing to do when creating this game was getting the values from different classes to update and run in my other classes. I think now though I am starting to understand how it works, though it is still very confusing at times.
